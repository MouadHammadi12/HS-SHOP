# TODO: Make Design More Professional

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Simplify color palette in Home.css (use neutral blues and grays instead of bright gradients)
- [x] Remove excessive animations (float, pulse, glow, etc.) and keep only subtle transitions
- [x] Clean up hero section (remove complex TV illustration, remote control, and background grids)
- [x] Improve typography and spacing for better readability
- [x] Ensure responsive design is maintained
- [x] Test the changes by running the app
